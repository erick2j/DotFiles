# DotFiles
Dotfiles for various programs such as Neovim, i3, and custom snippets for VimTeX.

# Introduction
I use a combination of [free software](https://directory.fsf.org/?pk_campaign=fsfredesign#About) and [open source software](https://opensource.org/about) to get my work done.
Whenever possible, I prefer to use free software over open source software, and I strictly avoid using closed, properietary software.
As a result, I have built a custom environment of free software to faciliate my workflow.
As a Computer Science PhD Student, my enviroment is custom built for coding in C, C++, Rust, as well as editing LaTeX documents.

The software I use includes:
* [i3](https://i3wm.org/) (Tiling Window Manager)
* [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (Text Editor)
* [Alacritty Terminal Emulator](https://alacritty.org/)
* [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) (a Vim Snippet plug-in)
* [Starship](https://starship.rs/) (Command Prompt)

I will only detail the installation and configuration of these programs on my own operating system (Ubuntu 22.04), though these installation steps
should work for most Linux distributions (with some modification). 
In particular, you may need to use the package manager that comes with your distribution (perhaps `pacman`) instead of `apt`.

# Installation

## i3 window manager
To install the i3 tiling window manager run:
```
sudo apt-get install i3
```
From there, you can log out of your desktop environment and choose to load the i3 tiling window manager.
When prompted as to whether you would like to generate an i3 configuration, opt 'yes' and replace that config file with mine!
More information on this to come.

## Neovim
To install Neovim simply run:
  ```
  sudo apt install neovim
  ```
