# DotFiles
Dotfiles for various programs such as Vim, i3, and custom snippets for VimTeX.

# Introduction
I use a combination of [free software](https://directory.fsf.org/?pk_campaign=fsfredesign#About) and [open source](https://opensource.org/about)
to get my work done.
The software I use includes:
* [i3](https://i3wm.org/) 
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (for managing Vim plug-ins)
* [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) (a Vim plug-in)
* [Alacritty Terminal Emulator](https://alacritty.org/)
* [Starship](https://starship.rs/) (Command Prompt)

I will only detail the installation and configuration of these programs on my own operating system (Ubuntu 22.04), though these installation steps
should work for most Linux distributions (with some modification). 
In particular, you may need to use the package manager that comes with your distribution (perhaps `pacman`) instead of `apt`.

# Installation

## i3 window manager
To install the i3 tiling window manager run:
```
sudo apt-get install i3
```
From there, you can log out of your desktop environment and choose to load the i3 tiling window manager.
When prompted as to whether you would like to generate an i3 configuration, opt 'yes' and replace that config file with mine!
More information on this to come.

## Vim
To install Vim simply run:
  ```
  sudo apt install vim
  ```
though you very likely already have this program.

## vim-plug
To install vim-plug, follow these [instructions](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
